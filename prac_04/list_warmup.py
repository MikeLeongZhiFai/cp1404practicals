"""numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]

1.numbers[0]

4.numbers[:-1]
5.numbers[3:4]
6)5 in numbers
7)7 in numbers
8)"3" in numbers
9)numbers + [6, 5, 3]

Ans:
Q1)The value of numbers[0] is 3.
Q2)The value of numbers[-1] is 2.
Q3)The value of numbers[3] is 1.
Q4)The value of numbers[:-1] is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]. This is a slice of the numbers list that includes all elements except the last one.
Q5)The value of numbers[3:4] is [1]. This is a slice of the numbers list that includes the element at index 3, but excludes the element at index 4.
Q6)The expression is 5 in numbers. This will return True if 5 is in the list, else false.
Q7)The expression is 7 in numbers. This will return False as 7 is not in the list.
Q8)The expression is "3" in numbers. This will return False because "3" is not in the list.
Q9)The value of numbers + [6, 5, 3] is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3].
This is a new list that contains the elements of numbers followed by the elements [6, 5, 3]."""
