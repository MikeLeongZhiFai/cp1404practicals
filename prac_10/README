1.When I looked back at the estimates I had made for the practical activities, I could see that my accuracy had increased over the course of the topic. There were times when I underestimated, but as the topic developed, I improved at estimating task difficulty and scheduling time effectively. The utilization of ongoing feedback loops and historical estimations proved to be crucial in improving my accuracy.

2.It has been insightful to take part in code reviews as the reviewer and the reviewed. I learned about various coding styles and best practices from having my code reviewed, which also pointed out places where it might be improved. On the other hand, I learned from conducting reviews how important it is to offer constructive criticism, promote teamwork, and value the variety of ways engineers use when tackling problems. It is a mutually beneficial learning process that improves communication and interpersonal abilities.

3.If I were in charge of the course, I might think about including more practical exercises with real-world, hands-on circumstances. This could close the knowledge gap between theory and practical application in projects. Furthermore, establishing a structured feedback mechanism—possibly via frequent retrospectives—could aid in refining the course structure in light of the requirements and experiences of the students. Promoting peer cooperation and knowledge exchange could enhance the educational process in general.
